# CivicPlus Terms and Conditions, SeeClickFix Services

These Terms and Conditions, inclusive of the Scope of Work (&quot;the SOW&quot;) to which they are inextricably linked (collectively
referred to as this &quot;Agreement&quot;), will apply as of the Effective Date (the date of signature specified in the SOW) to the
customer signing the SOW (&quot;Customer&quot;) in relation to CivicPlus, LLC a Kansas limited liability company, located at 302 S
4th Street, Manhattan, KS 66502 (&quot;CivicPlus&quot;) (individually referred to as &quot;Party&quot; and collectively the
&quot;Parties&quot;). WHEREAS, the Customer desires that CivicPlus provide certain software services as described in the
SOW. WHEREAS, CivicPlus desires to deliver such software services under these terms and conditions.

* **A. Term and Termination**

    1. CivicPlus and the Customer will implement the SeeClickFix services described in the SOW (the &quot;Services&quot;) as soon as
    reasonable. These Terms and Conditions will apply throughout the SOW-specified period following the Effective Date and be
    automatically renewed on an annual basis each succeeding year (the &quot;Term&quot;), and shall include changes to these Terms and
    Conditions which may be enacted by CivicPlus alone. Should either Party decide not to extend the term, such Party must notify, in
    writing, the other Party at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term.

    1. Termination for Cause. If either Party fails to perform any of its material obligations under these Terms and Conditions and does
    not cure such failures within thirty (30) days after being given written notice specifying the nature of the failure, then the
    non-defaulting Party may, by giving written notice to the other Party, terminate all services as of the date specified in such
    notice of termination.

    1. Upon termination of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Customer by Section D.3, below, will terminate; customer shall cease
    all use of the CivicPlus Material and the Services listed in the SOW.

    1. The following Sections and any payment obligations hereunder shall survive any expiration or termination of service: A(4), D, E,
    G and H (except H.4).

* **B. Invoicing and Payment Terms**

    1. Invoices for the Services will be sent electronically to the individual/entity designated in the SOW and Contact Sheet provided
    to Customer, which is to be filled out and submitted by Customer. Customer shall provide accurate, current and complete
    information of Customer&#39;s legal name, address, email address, and phone number, and maintain and promptly update this
    information if it should change. CivicPlus will email all invoices to the email address designated in the Contact Sheet. Upon
    request CivicPlus will mail invoices, and Customer will be charged a $5.00 convenience fee.

    2. Payment is due 30 days from date of invoice. Unless otherwise permitted by law, a finance charge of 1.5% per month or $5.00,
    whichever is greater, will be added to past due accounts. Payments received will be applied first to finance charges, then to the
    oldest outstanding invoice(s).

    3. If Customer&#39;s account exceeds 60 days past due, support will be discontinued until the Customer&#39;s account is made
    current. If the Customer&#39;s account exceeds 90 days past due, annual hosting services will be discontinued and the
    Customer&#39;s Services will no longer be active until the Customer&#39;s account is made current. Customer will be given 30
    days&#39; notice prior to discontinuation of the Services for non-payment.

    4. CivicPlus passes through sales tax in those jurisdictions where such tax is required. If the Customer is tax-exempt, the
    Customer must provide CivicPlus proof of their tax-exempt status, within fifteen (15) days of contract signing, and the fees owned
    by Customer under this Agreement will not be taxed. If the Customer&#39;s state taxation laws change, the Customer will begin to
    be charged sales tax in accordance with their jurisdiction&#39;s tax requirements and CivicPlus has the right to collect payment
    from the Customer for past due taxes.

* **C. Services of CivicPlus**

    Use and Privacy Policy, CivicPlus may not be able to control the exact nature of the User Content. CivicPlus reserves the right,
    not the obligation, to edit User Content. Although CivicPlus may from time to time make enhancements or bug fixes to the Software,
