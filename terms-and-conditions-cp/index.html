<p>These Terms and Conditions, inclusive of the Scope of Work ("the SOW") to which they are inextricably linked (collectively
referred to as this "Agreement"), will apply as of the Effective Date (the date of signature specified in the SOW) to the
customer signing the SOW ("Customer") in relation to CivicPlus, LLC a Kansas limited liability company, located at 302 S
4th Street, Manhattan, KS 66502 ("CivicPlus") (individually referred to as "Party" and collectively the
"Parties"). WHEREAS, the Customer desires that CivicPlus provide certain software services as described in the
SOW. WHEREAS, CivicPlus desires to deliver such software services under these terms and conditions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A. Term and Termination</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>CivicPlus and the Customer will implement the SeeClickFix services described in the SOW (the "Services") as soon as
  reasonable. These Terms and Conditions will apply throughout the SOW-specified period following the Effective Date and be
  automatically renewed on an annual basis each succeeding year (the "Term"), and shall include changes to these Terms and
  Conditions which may be enacted by CivicPlus alone. Should either Party decide not to extend the term, such Party must notify, in
  writing, the other Party at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Termination for Cause. If either Party fails to perform any of its material obligations under these Terms and Conditions and does
  not cure such failures within thirty (30) days after being given written notice specifying the nature of the failure, then the
  non-defaulting Party may, by giving written notice to the other Party, terminate all services as of the date specified in such
  notice of termination.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Upon termination of this Agreement, the licenses granted to Customer by Section D.3, below, will terminate; customer shall cease
  all use of the CivicPlus Material and the Services listed in the SOW.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The following Sections and any payment obligations hereunder shall survive any expiration or termination of service: A(4), D, E,
  G and H (except H.4).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>B. Invoicing and Payment Terms</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Invoices for the Services will be sent electronically to the individual/entity designated in the SOW and Contact Sheet provided
  to Customer, which is to be filled out and submitted by Customer. Customer shall provide accurate, current and complete
  information of Customer's legal name, address, email address, and phone number, and maintain and promptly update this
  information if it should change. CivicPlus will email all invoices to the email address designated in the Contact Sheet. Upon
  request CivicPlus will mail invoices, and Customer will be charged a $5.00 convenience fee.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Payment is due 30 days from date of invoice. Unless otherwise permitted by law, a finance charge of 1.5% per month or $5.00,
  whichever is greater, will be added to past due accounts. Payments received will be applied first to finance charges, then to the
  oldest outstanding invoice(s).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If Customer's account exceeds 60 days past due, support will be discontinued until the Customer's account is made
  current. If the Customer's account exceeds 90 days past due, annual hosting services will be discontinued and the
  Customer's Services will no longer be active until the Customer's account is made current. Customer will be given 30
  days' notice prior to discontinuation of the Services for non-payment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CivicPlus passes through sales tax in those jurisdictions where such tax is required. If the Customer is tax-exempt, the
  Customer must provide CivicPlus proof of their tax-exempt status, within fifteen (15) days of contract signing, and the fees owned
  by Customer under this Agreement will not be taxed. If the Customer's state taxation laws change, the Customer will begin to
  be charged sales tax in accordance with their jurisdiction's tax requirements and CivicPlus has the right to collect payment
  from the Customer for past due taxes.</p>

      <li>
        <p>The Parties agree that except for the right of either party to seek declaratory, injunctive or other equitable relief, or for
  claims related to a Party's Intellectual Property Rights, any dispute or controversy arising out of or in connection with these
  Terms and Conditions shall be referred to arbitration for final and binding resolution. Either Party to these Terms and Conditions
  may initiate arbitration of the dispute by the filing of an application for resolution by one arbitrator appointed by and in
  accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in the city and state in
  which the non-filing Party is located. The award in the arbitration shall be final, binding and non-appealable. The award may be

  this Section G is a material term of these Terms and Conditions and acknowledges that it would not enter into these Terms and
  Conditions in the absence of this Section G. Each Party warrants and represents to the other party that this Section G is valid and
  enforceable and the other party will incur damages if such representation is false.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The laws of United States and the State of Kansas shall govern these Terms and Conditions, without regard to conflicts of laws
  principles. Each Party hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the State of Kansas and federal courts located in the State of Kansas.</p>

    <p><strong>H. General</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Independent Contractor Relationship. CivicPlus is acting as an independent contractor under these Terms and Conditions and
  nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed or construed to create the relationship of partnership, joint venture or
  employer- employee between the Parties. Neither Party has, and shall not hold itself out as having, any authority to enter into any
  contract or create any obligation or liability on behalf of, in the name of, or binding upon the other Party.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Force Majeure. No Party shall have any liability to the other hereunder by reason of delay or failure to perform any obligation
  or covenant if the delay or failure to perform is due to any cause beyond the control of such Party, including without limitation,
  catastrophic storm, fire, casualty, unanticipated work stoppage, strike, lockout, labor dispute, civic disturbance, riot, war,
  national emergency, act of public enemy, or other cause beyond the control of the non-performing Party.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any notice to be given hereunder to any other Party, including any notice of a change of address, shall be in writing and shall

  prepaid, return receipt requested or (iii) sent by email, as follows: If to CivicPlus: CivicPlus, LLC, Attn: Contract Administrator
  to <a href="mailto:accounting@civicplus.com">accounting@civicplus.com,</a> with an email response confirming receipt by CivicPlus. If to

  its features will be accompanied by a reference that it is provided by CivicPlus.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Amendment or Waiver. No amendment or modification of these Terms and Conditions by the Customer shall be valid, unless in writing
  and signed by both Parties.</p>

  considered in construction of the provisions hereof.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
  unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of these Terms and Conditions, which shall be construed as if such invalid or
  unenforceable provision had never been a part of these Terms and Conditions but in a manner so as to carry out as nearly as possible
  the Parties' original intent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Contract may be executed simultaneously in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but which together
  shall constitute one and the same instrument.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Entire Contract. These Terms and Conditions, inclusive of the SOW to which they are inextricably linked, the published Terms of
  Use and Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
  letters of intent, memorandums of understanding, confidentiality agreements, and other contracts and communications, oral or
  written, between the Parties regarding such subject matter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>CivicPlus may assign these Terms and Conditions, and then notify the Customer within 30 days thereof.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Authorized Signor. Each person signing this Agreement represents and warrants that he or she is duly authorized and has legal
  capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement. Each Party represents and warrants to the other that the execution and delivery of
  the Agreement and the performance of such Party's obligations hereunder have been duly authorized and that the Agreement is a
  valid and legal agreement binding on such Party and enforceable in accordance with its terms.</p>
