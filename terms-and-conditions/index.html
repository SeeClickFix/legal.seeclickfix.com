<h1 id="seeclickfix-terms-and-conditions">SeeClickFix Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>These Terms and Conditions, inclusive of the Scope of Services Proposal
(“the SSP”) to which they are inextricably linked, will apply as of the
Effective Date (specified in the SSP) to the customer (“Customer”) in
relation to SeeClickFix Inc, a Delaware Corporation located at 746

Parties”). WHEREAS, the Customer desires that SeeClickFix provide certain
software services as described herein. WHEREAS, SeeClickFix desires to
deliver such software services under these terms and conditions.</p>

<p>A. Term and Termination.</p>

<p>SeeClickFix and the Customer will implement the services described in the
SSP as soon as reasonable.  These Terms and Conditions will apply
throughout the SSP-specified period following the Effective Date and be
automatically renewed on an annual basis each succeeding year, and shall
include changes to these Terms and Conditions which may be enacted by
SeeClickFix alone. 
Should either party decide not to
extend the term, such party must notify, in writing, the other party at
least 90 days prior to the end of the current term.
Termination for Cause.  If either party fails to perform any of its
material obligations under these Terms and Conditions and does not cure
such failures within thirty (30) days after being given written notice
specifying the nature of the failure, then the non-defaulting party may,
by giving written notice to the other party, terminate all services as
of the date specified in such notice of termination.
Survival.  The following Sections and any payment obligations hereunder
shall survive any expiration or termination of service: A(3), C, D, E
and and F (except F.3). 
B. Services of SeeClickFix.  SeeClickFix will provide on a hosted,
software-as-a-service basis, access to the Services described in the
foregoing Order Form, via mobile applications, internet, and an

non-emergency issues (“the Software”).  Users will be able to interact
with the Software and post various content including words, photos and
videos.  While the content of users of the Software is governed by
SeeClickFix’s published Terms of Use, SeeClickFix may not be able to
control the exact nature of this content.  SeeClickFix reserve the right
to edit User Content, but does not have an obligation to edit the
content.  Although SeeClickFix may from time to time make enhancements
or bug fixes to the Software, it is under no obligation to make any
particular modifications, enhancements or bug fixes.</p>

<p>C. Ownership. With the exception of Customer’s trademarks and logos,
SeeClickFix shall be the sole and exclusive owner of any and all
SeeClickFix Materials, including the Software and all Intellectual

MAKES NO, AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE
OR NONINFRINGEMENT) TO CLIENT, OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON, WITH RESPECT TO
THE SERVICES, SEECLICKFIX MATERIALS, OR ANY OTHER SERVICES OR MATERIALS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER.  (I) NEITHER SEECLICKFIX NOR THE CITY SHALL HAVE ANY
LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE), AND
(II) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY TO THE
OTHER PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF
FEES RECEIVED BY SEECLICKFIX FROM THE CITY FOR THE THREE (3) MONTHS
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY OR $5,000
WHICHEVER IS LESS.</p>

<p>E. Arbitration, Governing Law and Venue</p>

<p>Arbitration.  The Parties agree that except for the right of either
party to seek declaratory, injunctive or other equitable relief, or for
claims related to a party’s Intellectual Property Rights, any dispute or
controversy arising out of or in connection with these Terms and
Conditions shall be referred to arbitration for final and binding
resolution. Either party to these Terms and Conditions may initiate
arbitration of the dispute by the filing of an application for
resolution by one arbitrator appointed by and in accordance with the
rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitration shall be
conducted in the city and state in which the non-filing Party is
located.  The award in the arbitration shall be final, binding and
non-appealable.  The award may be entered as a final, non-appealable
judgment in any court having jurisdiction.  Each party specifically
agrees and acknowledges that this Section is a material term of these
Terms and Conditions and acknowledges that it would not enter into these
Terms and Conditions in the absence of this Section.  Each party
warrants and represents to the other party that this Section is valid
and enforceable and the other party will incur damages if such
representation is false.
Law. The laws of United States and the State of Connecticut shall govern
these Terms and Conditions, without regard to conflicts of laws
principles. Each of the parties hereby submits to the jurisdiction of
the State of Connecticut and federal courts located in the State of
Connecticut.
F. General</p>

<p>Independent Contractor Relationship.  SeeClickFix is acting as an
independent contractor under these Terms and Conditions and nothing in
these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed or construed to create the
relationship of partnership, joint venture or employer-employee between
the parties. Neither party has, and shall not hold itself out as having,
any authority to enter into any contract or create any obligation or
liability on behalf of, in the name of, or binding upon the other party.
Notices.  Any notice to be given hereunder to any other party, including
any notice of a change of address, shall be in writing and shall be
deemed validly given if (i) delivered personally or (ii) sent by express
delivery service, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return

SeeClickFix Inc., Attn: Contract Administrator to team@seeclickfix.com,
with an email response confirming receipt by SeeClickFix.  If to Customer:
as addressed in the SSP.  All such notices shall be deemed given on the
date of actual receipt by the addressee if delivered personally, on the
date of deposit with the express delivery service or the postal
authorities if sent in either such manner, on the date the facsimile or
email is sent if sent in such manner, and on the date of actual receipt
by the addressee if delivered in any other manner.

Amendment or Waiver.  No amendment or modification of these Terms and
Conditions by the Customer shall be valid.
Headings and Captions.  The headings and captions of these Terms and
Conditions are included for convenience only and shall not be considered
in construction of the provisions hereof.
Severability.  If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or
unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of these Terms and
Conditions, which shall be construed as if such invalid or unenforceable
provision had never been a part of these Terms and Conditions but in a
manner so as to carry out as nearly as possible the parties’ original
intent.
These Terms and Conditions, inclusive of the SSP to which they are
inextricably linked, constitute the entire agreement between the parties
regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any letters of
intent, memorandums of understanding, confidentiality Contracts, and
other Contracts and communications, oral or written, between the parties
regarding such subject matter.

notify the Customer within 30 days thereof.</p>
